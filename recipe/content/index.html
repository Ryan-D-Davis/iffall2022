            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>  
            <li>⅓ cup Filipino cane vinegar or white vinegar</li>    
            <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, short juliennes</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves (Can substitue with fresh thyme)</li>
            <li>Chopped cilantro or green onions for garnish</li>
            <li>Jasmine rice for serving</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <h2>Prep</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, vinegar and black pepper in a casserole dish or a zip-top bag.</li>
            <li>Trim off excess fat from the chicken, then add the chicken to the marinade. Let marinate for at least 20 minutes.</li>          
        </ol>
        <h2>Cook</h2>
        <p>*Pro-Tip: If serving with rice, soak the rice during the first few stages, then place it in rice as you begin braising!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium sized pot or skillet just wide enough to fit all the chicken in one layer, add a little vegetable oil and onions. Cook the onions, stirring frequently, over medium low heat until the caramelized, soft and sweet. If you notice that the pan has a lot of browned bits stuck to the bottom, deglaze with a bit of water. When the onions are almost done, add garlic and bay leaves and cook for a few more minutes until the onions are done.</li>
            <li>Push the onions to one side of the pan then add a little oil to the empty space. Turn the heat up to medium high and wait for the pan to get hot. Add the chicken pieces, skin side down and let sear for a minute or two to brown the skin.</li>
            <li>Once browned, flip the chicken and add the marinade. Add a little more water so that the sauce comes up right under the chicken skin (about ¾ submerged). Cover and turn the heat to low so the liquid is gently bubbling. Braise for 30 minutes or until the chicken is fork tender. If you want you can flip the chicken at about halfway through.</li>
            <li>When the chicken is done braising, if you wish to concentrate the sauce further, you can open the lid and reduce the sauce over high heat for another few minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped green onion and/or cilantro and serve with jasmine rice. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>*Pro-Tip: Adobo tastes even better the day after, so make sure to store some leftovers!</p>

        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">Allrecipes:</a> I like this recipe website because of the way it very clearly labels and categorizes things. Its extensive search function would make this website very accessible to everyday cooking.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.epicurious.com/search">Epicurious:</a> Similarly to the previous, I like this website for its search function. Additionally, I think that the layout of the website is great. The search bar is easy to find, and if you want something more specific, its advanced search page lays out the filters clearly.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.yummly.com/">Yummly:</a> This website feels like an amalgamation of what I liked from the previous two websites. The design is sleek and the use of images both livens up the website and provides context to some text.</li>

            <li><a href="https://www.superlist.com/">Superlist:</a> I think this is a good website because it has a minimalist design while not feeling rigid.</li>
            <!-- <li><a href="https://www.ideo.com/blog">Ideo:</a> I like this website's use of colors and the integration of illustrations. I want to see if there is a way I can integrate visuals outside of just placing the </li> -->
            <li><a href="https://cupofjo.com/">Cup of Jo:</a> I like this website's simple color pallete. The use of a cream color background instead of a white one gives it a homey feel which I would like to achieve in my recipe page. Likewise, the small pops of red and blue add a feeling of playfulness that I enjoy.</li>
            <a href="http://reimagineplay.space/animated/index.html">Reimagine Play:</a> I like the gif illustration and how it interacts with the user. It is definetly a more extreme example than what I'd want to integrate, but I would like to see if there are more creative solutions to the food visuals.</li> -->
