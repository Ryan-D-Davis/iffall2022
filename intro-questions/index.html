        <p>1: Hi, my name's Ryan Davis. I'm a junior studying Communication Design.</p>
        <p>2: I am interested in pursuing a career in storyboarding. This class is a part of my major requirement.</p>
        <p>3: I have minimal experience in JS from the Intro to Computer Science class I took freshmen year.</p>
        <p>4: I hope to learn how to make a portolio website.</p>
        <p>5: I think that one of the biggest differences in designing for the screen is that your design must be appealing across all screen sized.</p>
        <p>6: I like the design of the <a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike</a> website. I think that it effectively advertises its products without feeling too in your face. I also appreciate the suddles fade in animations on the images when you scroll.</p>
        <p>7: I would say the <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">Adobe Color</a> website is an example of effective communication because of how simple it is. The clearly titled buttons and user interaction make it very easy to use.</p>
        <p>8: The <a href="https://designarchives.aiga.org/#/home">Aiga Design</a> website in an example of a website which works well in my opinion. I like how well labeled everything is, and I also enjoy how it lays out the collections for easy viewing.</p>
